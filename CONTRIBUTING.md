# Contributing to Donation History

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Donation History. Currently, we have no formal process for contribution as this is a new project.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Getting Involved and Filing Issues

Immediately jumping in and adding code may be difficult at this stage in the project, so we promote adding Issues to Github to start conversations about potential dev work. Issues don't have to be bugs! They can be feature requests, suggestions, questions of clarification, ...and of course bugs. As you are writing an issue, ask yourself, is my issue:

* Written clearly and in the style of a user story?
* Labeled clearly with the type of help you need?
* Detailed with additional documentation as needed?

You can find more about writing good issues [over at 18F](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/writing-clear-and-concise-issues/).

## Developing

We do not yet have guidelines for pull-requests or for how to set up a development environment. As the project grows, this section will grow. For now, keep the following best practices in mind:

* Work in a feature branch.
* Don't add unnecessary components to package.xml.
* Don't add dependencies on managed packages (NPSP, PatronDonate, etc...)
* This package must be configurable by an admin. Use custom labels instead of language strings.

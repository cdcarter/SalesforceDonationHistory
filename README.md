# Donation History Pagelet

This package includes pagelets to display donation history on the standard Account and Contact page layouts. Donation history is summarized by year, record type, and opportunity contact roles. There is a custom setting to help configure the pagelets and what donations are relevant to them.

This package is "base package agnostic" and should be suitable for any NPO using Opportunity to track donations. It has been tested with NPSP 3.0 and PatronTechnology's PatronManager.

It looks great in Aloha:

and in the Lightning Experience!

The package was initially commissioned by Caroline Renard, after seeing the  giving totals pagelet from Groundwire Base.
